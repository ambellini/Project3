        <h1>Angeline Bellini</h1>
        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>My name is Angeline Bellini and I am 20 years old and currently in school for Advertising and Graphic Design. I have loved art for a long time and I love creating my own weirdly interesting art. After I am finished with my degree I would like to pursue a career in graphic design so that I can share my creativity with everyone. I love thinking of new things to create and I enjoy making things that most people wouldnâ€™t even think of. I love drawing with pen and pencil but I have become skilled in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign over the past few years and Procreate as of recently. I think there are many talented graphic designers now and it can only get better as time goes on.</p>

          <h3>Cyclops</h3>
          <img src="Cyclops.jpg" alt="Cyclops" width=350 height=450>
          <p class="test">This was an independent project that I made to test the waters with the drawing app Procreate. I wanted to make something beautifully unusual and I think that I accomplished that with the purple skin and only having one eye in the image. This is one of my favorite projects that I have made because it came directly from my head and the colors look really nice together and I really enjoy good color theory. </p>

          <h3>April Greiman</h3>
          <img src="Bellini-Pj2-Poster.pdf" alt="April Greiman" width=350 height=450>
          <p class="test">This was a project that I created for a class where we had to make a poster of a well-known graphic designer. I wanted to make something that looked similar to her work I had to incorperate her face per project instructions. I really like how this project turned out, I made it using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. </p>
